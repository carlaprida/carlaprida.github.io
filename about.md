I’m a Dominican/Spanish graphic designer currently living in Barcelona. 

After graduating from high school I decided to leave my home country of the Dominican Republic and move to the United States, where I was awarded a full scholarship to study Advertising at Michigan State University. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 2015 and moved to Barcelona where I did a Masters in Graphic Design, at ELISAVA School of Design and Engineering.

I’m inspired by the greatness in simple things. I continue to question how good design works, and try to challenge myself daily. Specialized in branding, editorial, and web design.
